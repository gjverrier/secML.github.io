### Introduction

### Malware History - Machine Learning Origins

### PDF Malware Classifiers

### Hidost: A Static Machine-Learning-Based Detector of Malicious Files

### Machine Learning on Malware is Hard

### State of the Art

### Future of the Field

### Conclusion

We've explored the current state of adversarial malware detection including Hidost. From simple to metamorphic viruses, malware has evolved into increasingly sophisticated threats. The field of adversarial malware detection has been evolving as well, as static and dynamic methods are developed that are increasingly effective at detecting malicious code. As the cutting edge of malware detection moves forward, we will see new fronts open up in the contest between malicious files and the algorithms that detect them.
